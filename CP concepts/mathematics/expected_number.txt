Expected Number :

Theory :

1. for getting N consecutive number of heads we have formula 

formula : X = 2^(N+1) - 2;

where X =  expected number 


Bernoullis trail : a Bernoulli trial (or binomial trial) is a random experiment with exactly two possible outcomes, "success" and "failure", 

So expected number  = 1/p     (for bernoulli trial only) for success
					  1/(1-p) (for failure)


Coupan Collector:

Problem : There are n unique coupans available in chips packets. There is a person who wants to get all unique coupans. 
So what is the expected number of chips packets to get all unique coupans.

E(X) = n(1+ 1/2 + 1/3+ 1/4+ 1/5+ .... + 1/n)
