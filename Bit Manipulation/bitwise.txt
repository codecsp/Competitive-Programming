Bit wise operators :

1.  &  (and) ---> both the bits should 1 

2.  || (Or)  ---> at least 1 bit is 1

3.  !  (Not) ---> Negation  
			 ---->flips all the bits from 1 to 0 & 0 to 1

4.  ^ (XOR)  ---> also called as exclusively or
			 ---> only either of the bits is 1  

5. << (Left Shift) --->multiplication by 2
	
	5 << 2 
	101 << 2 --> 1010 << 10100    = 20
 
 so, a<<b == a * 2^b;

6. >> (Right Shift)  --> Divison by 2

 	20 >> 2
 	10100 >> 2 = 101   =  5

 so, a>>b = a/(2^b) ;
